		"longDescription": "<p>This is the usage documentation for the Despegar API. <br/> For other, more detailed, information <a href='##BASE_URL##/docs/page/fullindex'>see here</a>.</p><p><b>WARNING</b>: We are currently deprecating version 1.0, if your application uses the <i>root</i> version in its configuration, it WILL break in a few months. <b>The new version will not be backward compatible</b>. Check your application(s) and make sure you are using the full version URL (for example <a href='##BASE_URL##/v1/languages'>http://api.despegar.com/v1/languages</a>) for all calls to our methods. For more information <a href='##BASE_URL##/docs/page/versions'>see here</a>.</p>",
		"projectSummary": "<p>All API responses are <a href='http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/JSON'>JSON</a>, we also support <a href='http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/JSON#JSONP'>JSONP</a> with the standard <code>callback</code> parameter.</p><p>API responses are heavily cached. Polling for changes should be done sparingly in any case, and polling at a rate faster than once a minute (for semantically identical requests) is considered abusive.</p><p>Additionally, all API responses are GZIP'd. The <code>Content-Encoding</code> header is always set, but some proxies will strip this out. The proper way to decode API responses can be found <a href='##BASE_URL##/docs/page/gzip'>here</a>.</p><p>In order to have a fair quantity of requests per day, you need to specify an API Key, see <a href='##BASE_URL##/docs/page/apikeys'>here</a> for more information.</p> <p>API usage is throttled by IP address. Each IP can make a certain number of requests per-day. Without an <a href='##BASE_URL##/docs/page/apikeys'>API key</a>, this limit is quite low.<br /> Note that API keys do not \"stack.\" A single IP running a dozen registered applications can make the same number of requests per day as an IP running a single registered application.</p>",
		"methodSummary": "<p>Many API methods are vectorized. That is to say, they will accept multiple values within a single parameter on a request.If a parameter on this page is in the url path and plural you can pass multiple values separated by commas. The documentation for specific methods will call out vectorized parameters further.</p><h3>Response</h3><p>All methods return a json string which contains three main root nodes -- although not all are present at all times. <ul><li><i><b>data</b></i>: This node may have a custom key like <i>availability</i> (generally the same as the top URL sub-level of the method), or simply be called <i>data</i>; it contains the actual result of the method. You can see each response structure in the method detail page clicking below.</li><br /><li><i><b>meta</b></i>: Contains summary information (meta data) of the method execution. Examples are <i>time</i>, which contains the milliseconds it took the method to complete, and <i>reference</i>, a unique identifier of the transaction used for tracking and debugging purposes.<br/> Each method may add specific summary data (like pagination information); see the <i>Response Summary</i> section in the method detail page for details.</li><br /><li><i><b>errors</b></i>: This node is only present when the method returned an error, and it contains details about what happened. Use the <i>reference</i> value from the meta node when reporting it back to us (assuming it's not a problem with the request, or something that can be solved on your end).</li></ul>",
